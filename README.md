# KNN_algorithm
The project aims to create a data classification program using the k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm. The program accepts three input arguments:

K – the number of nearest neighbors to consider for classification.
Train-set – a CSV file containing the training data.
Test-set – a CSV file containing the test data.
The program performs k-NN classification for all test data based on the training set and then calculates and displays the classification accuracy.

Additionally, the program features an interface that allows the user to input a single data vector for classification, after which it returns the label assigned to that vector based on the training set.

Project Goals:
Implement the k-NN algorithm for data classification.
Calculate the classification accuracy on the test set.
Create a simple interface for classifying individual samples provided by the user.
Test the program using the well-known Iris dataset, where the data is split into 105 training samples and 45 test samples.
